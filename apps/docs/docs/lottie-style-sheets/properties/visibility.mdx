# visibility

The `visibility` property in LSS controls whether a layer or shape is visible or not. The default value for visibility
is 'visible'. If you wish to hide a layer or shape, set its visibility to 'hidden'.

Here's an example of how to use the visibility property:

```css
#my-layer {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

In this example, the layer with the ID 'my-layer' will be hidden.
