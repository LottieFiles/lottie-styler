# stroke-width

The `stroke-width` property in LSS specifies the width of the stroke on `StrokeShape` and `GradientStrokeShape`. You can
provide a numeric value representing the stroke width in pixels.

Here's how you can use the stroke-width property:

## For `StrokeShape`

```css
StrokeShape {
  stroke-width: 5;
}
```

In this example, the `StrokeShape` will have a stroke width of 5 pixels.

## For `GradientStrokeShape`

```css
GradientStrokeShape {
  stroke-width: 10;
}
```

In this example, the `GradientStrokeShape` will have a stroke width of 10 pixels.
