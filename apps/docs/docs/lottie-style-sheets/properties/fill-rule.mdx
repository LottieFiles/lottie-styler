# fill-rule

The `fill-rule` property in Lottie Style Sheets (LSS) specifies how to fill a path. It's used to determine the
"insideness" of a point. The `fill-rule` can have two values: `nonzero` (Non Zero) and `evenodd` (Even Odd).

## Using `nonzero`

import Example from '@site/src/components/Example';

<Example
  code={'\nFillShape {\n fill-rule: nonzero; \n}'}
  fileUrl="https://assets10.lottiefiles.com/packages/lf20_xUhmAOKNrC.json"
/>

In this example, all paths of type `FillShape` will use the "nonzero" fill-rule.

### NonZero Fill Rule

The `nonzero` fill-rule is a way to fill everything, irrespective of the intersections or direction of paths. With this
fill rule, all areas of the `FillShape` are colored, creating an effect similar to an OR operation. It's the equivalent
of saying, "fill all areas of the shape that are not zero".

Here's an example:

```css
FillShape {
  fill-rule: nonzero;
}
```

In this example, the `FillShape` will be filled using the "nonzero" fill-rule.

## Using `evenodd`

```css
FillShape {
  fill-rule: evenodd;
}
```

In this example, the `FillShape` will use the "evenodd" fill-rule.

### EvenOdd Fill Rule

The `evenodd` fill-rule colors the `FillShape` based on the intersections and path direction. It can be used to create
"holes" in your shapes, as it alternates between coloring and not coloring each time a path is intersected. This rule is
handy when you have complex paths with overlapping segments.

Here's an example:

```css
FillShape {
  fill-rule: evenodd;
}
```

In this example, the `FillShape` will be filled using the "evenodd" fill-rule, creating interesting effects based on the
intersections of the paths.
