# Selectors

Selectors in Lottie Style Sheets (LSS) are used to target specific layers or shapes for styling. They can be broken down
into four categories: ID, Class, Type, and Attribute selectors.

## ID Selector

An ID selector targets a layer or shape based on its ID. To style a shape or layer, assign it an ID and then style it
using this ID. Here's an example of how to use the ID selector:

```css
#my-fill-shape {
  fill-color: red;
}
```

In this example, the shape with the ID 'my-fill-shape' is filled with red color.

## Class Selector

A class selector targets a layer or shape based on its class. To use a class selector, assign a class to a layer or
shape and style it using this class. Here's an example:

```css
.my-shape {
  fill-color: red;
}
```

In this example, all shapes with the class 'my-shape' will be filled with red color.

## Type Selector

A type selector targets a layer or shape based on its type. Supported types in LSS include `FillShape`, `StrokeShape`,
`SolidColorLayer`, `ImageLayer`, `GradientFillShape`, and `GradientStrokeShape`. Here's how you can use the type
selector:

```css
FillShape {
  fill-color: red;
}
```

In this example, all shapes of type `FillShape` will be filled with red color.

## Attribute Selector

An attribute selector targets a layer or shape based on an attribute. Supported attributes include `name`, `id`, and
`class`. Here's an example of how to use an attribute selector:

```css
[name='my-fill-shape'] {
  fill-color: red;
}
```

In this example, all shapes with the attribute name equal to 'my-fill-shape' will be filled with red color.
