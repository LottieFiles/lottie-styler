# Lottie Styler

Lottie Styler serves as a comprehensive monorepo for Lottie theming tools. Our aim is to revolutionize the way designers and developers work with Lottie animations, equipping them with the tools to alter animation properties dynamically. This repository houses a range of tools, including the relottie ecosystem, to streamline and enrich the Lottie theming experience.

## Features

Dynamic Customization: Adjust animation properties on-the-fly, ensuring responsive and high-performance animations.
Comprehensive Integration: Designed to work seamlessly with the [relottie](https://github.com/LottieFiles/relottie) ecosystem and other Lottie-related tools.
Versatile Styling Properties: Supports a broad spectrum of styling properties for comprehensive theming.

## Packages

- `relottie-style`: A relottie plugin that processes the Lottie animation JSON and applies the LSS, using a CSS-in-JS approach for styling.

Follow the specific `README.md` for each package for more detailed usage instructions.
